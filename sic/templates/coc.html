            <h1>Community Code of Conduct</h1>
            <p><em>Version 1.0. <time datetime="2021-07-21" title="2021-07-21">2021-07-21</time></em></p>
            <p><em>In this document, </em><strong><code>[sic]</code></strong><em> refers to all active users that are registered on this website and/or take part in public channels of communication </em>(&hairsp;<em>such as IRC</em>&hairsp;)<em> that are endorsed and managed as part of this community.</em></p>
        </header>
        <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
        <p>A primary goal of <strong><code>[sic]</code></strong> is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).</p>
        <p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.</p>
        <p>We invite all those who participate in <strong><code>[sic]</code></strong> to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.</p>
        <h2>2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship</h2>
        <p>A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.</p>
        <p>Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.</p>
        <p>If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.</p>
        <h2>3. Expected Behavior</h2>
        <p>The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.</li>
            <li>Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.</li>
            <li>Attempt collaboration before conflict.</li>
            <li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.</li>
            <li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>4. Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

            <li>Inappropriate photography or recording.</li>
            <li>Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them.</li>
            <li>Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
        <p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.</p>
        <p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.</p>
        <p>If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.</p>
        <h2>6. Reporting Guidelines</h2>
        <p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible.</p>
        <h2>7. Addressing Grievances</h2>
        <p>If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify  with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.</p>
        <h2>8. Scope</h2>
        <p>We expect all community participants (users, contributors, sponsors) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues&mdash;online and in-person&mdash;as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community activity.</p>
        <p>This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.</p>
